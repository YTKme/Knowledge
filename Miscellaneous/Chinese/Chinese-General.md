## Tone

Tone is the use of pitch in language to distinguish lexical or
grammatical meaning, that is, to distinguish or to inflect words.

Tones are an essential part of proper pronunciation. In Mandarin
Chinese, many characters have the same sound. Therefore tones are
necessary when speaking Chinese in order to differentiate words from
each other.

- **First Tone:** a level and higher pitch
- **Second Tone:** rising, start from a lower pitch and end at a slightly higher pitch
- **Third Tone:** falling rising, start at a neutral tone then dip to a lower pitch before ending at a higher pitch
- **Fourth Tone:** falling, start the syllable at a slightly higher than neutral pitch then go quickly and strongly downwards
